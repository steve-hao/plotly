It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range countries declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. The West African lion population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.\n\nImage(https://i.pinimg.com/736x/da/af/73/daaf73960eb5a21d6bca748195f12052--lion-photography-lion-kings.jpg)\n---\n# The Giraffe\n\nThe giraffe is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies.\n\nImage(https://img.purch.com/w/192/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA2OC8wOTQvaTMwMC9naXJhZmZlLmpwZz8xNDA1MDA4NDQy)\nImage(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Giraffe_standing.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nmy_pres = pres.Presentation(markdown_string)\npres_url_2 = py.presentation_ops.upload(my_pres, filename)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["[https://plotly.com/~AdamKulidjian/3702/pres-with-images/](https://plotly.com/~AdamKulidjian/3702/pres-with-images/)"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport IPython\n\niframe_2 = url_to_iframe(pres_url_2, True)\nIPython.display.HTML(iframe_2)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["#### Image Stretch[\u00b6](#Image-Stretch)\r\n\r\nIf you want to ensure that your image maintains its original width:height ratio, include the parameter `imgStretch=False` in your `pres.Presentation()` function call."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py\nimport chart_studio.presentation_objs as pres\n\nfilename = 'pres-with-no-imgstretch'\nmarkdown_string = \"\"\"\n# images in native aspect ratio\n\nImage(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackparmer/gradient-backgrounds/master/moods1.png)\nImage(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackparmer/gradient-backgrounds/master/moods1.png)\nImage(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackparmer/gradient-backgrounds/master/moods1.png)\nImage(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackparmer/gradient-backgrounds/master/moods1.png)\nImage(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackparmer/gradient-backgrounds/master/moods1.png)\n\"\"\"\n\nmy_pres = pres.Presentation(markdown_string, imgStretch=False)\npres_url_3 = py.presentation_ops.upload(my_pres, filename)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["[https://plotly.com/~AdamKulidjian/3703/pres-with-no-imgstretch/](https://plotly.com/~AdamKulidjian/3703/pres-with-no-imgstretch/)"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport IPython\n\niframe_3 = url_to_iframe(pres_url_3, False)\nIPython.display.HTML(iframe_3)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["#### Transitions[\u00b6](#Transitions)\r\n\r\nYou can specify how your want your slides to transition to one another.
