We now recommend Kaleido, as described in the [Static Image Export](/python/static-image-export/) section .\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [Static Image Export](/python/static-image-export/) section for general information on creating static images from plotly.py figures.\r\n\r\n### What is orca?[\u00b6](#What-is-orca?)\r\n\r\nOrca is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application that inputs plotly figure specifications and converts them into static images.  Orca can run as a command-line utility or as a long-running server process. In order to provide the fastest possible image export experience, plotly.py launches orca in server mode, and communicates with it over a local port. See [https://github.com/plotly/orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca) for more information.\r\n\r\nBy default, plotly.py launches the orca server process the first time an image export operation is performed, and then leaves it running until the main Python process exits. Because of this, the first image export operation in an interactive session will typically take a couple of seconds, but then all subsequent export operations will be significantly faster, since the server is already running.\r\n\r\n### Installing orca[\u00b6](#Installing-orca)\r\n\r\nThere are 3 general approaches to installing orca and its Python dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### conda[\u00b6](#conda)\r\n\r\nUsing the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager, you can install these dependencies in a single command:"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["**Note:** Even if you do not want to use conda to manage your Python dependencies, it is still useful as a cross platform tool for managing native libraries and command-line utilities (e.g. git, wget, graphviz, boost, gcc, nodejs, cairo, etc.).  For this use-case, start with [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (~60MB) and tell the installer to add itself to your system `PATH`.  Then run `conda install plotly-orca==1.2.1` and the orca executable will be available system wide.\r\n\r\n##### npm + pip[\u00b6](#npm-+-pip)\r\n\r\nYou can use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) package manager to install `orca` (and its `electron` dependency), and then use pip to install `psutil`:"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["##### Standalone Binaries + pip[\u00b6](#Standalone-Binaries-+-pip)\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to install conda or npm, you can install orca as a precompiled binary for your operating system.

For example, if timeout is set to 20, then the orca server will shutdown once is has not been used for at least 20 seconds. If timeout is set to `None` (the default), then the server will not be automatically shut down due to inactivity.\r\n*  **`default_width`**: The default pixel width to use on image export.\r\n*  **`default_height`**: The default pixel height to use on image export.\r\n*  **`default_scale`**: The default image scale factor applied on image export.\r\n*  **`default_format`**: The default image format used on export.
