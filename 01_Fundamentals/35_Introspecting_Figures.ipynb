At render-time, figure objects (whether generated via [Plotly Express](/python/plotly-express/) or [Graph Objects](/python/graph-objects/) are passed from Plotly.py to [Plotly.js](/javascript/), which is the Javascript library responsible for turning JSON descriptions of figures into graphical representations.\r\n\r\nAs part of this rendering process, Plotly.js will determine, based on the attributes that have been set, which other attributes require values in order to draw the figure. Plotly.js will then apply either static or dynamic defaults to all of the remaining required attributes and render the figure. A good example of a static default would be the text font size: if unspecified, the default value is always the same. A good example of a dynamic default would be the range of an axis: if unspecified, the default will be computed based on the range of the data in traces associated with that axis."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["### Introspecting Plotly Express Figures[\u00b6](#Introspecting-Plotly-Express-Figures)\r\n\r\nFigure objects created by [Plotly Express](/python/plotly-express/) have a number of attributes automatically set, and these can be introspected using the Python `print()` function, or in JupyterLab, the special `fig.show(\"json\")` renderer, which gives an interactive drilldown interface with search:"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nfig = px.scatter(x=[10, 20], y=[20, 10], height=400, width=400)\nfig.show()\nprint(fig)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["We can learn more about the attributes Plotly Express has set for us with the Python `help()` function:"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nhelp(fig.data[0].__class__.mode)\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["### Accessing Javascript-Computed Defaults[\u00b6](#Accessing-Javascript-Computed-Defaults)\r\n\r\n_new in 4.10_\r\n\r\nThe `.full_figure_for_development()` method provides Python-level access to the default values computed by Plotly.js.
