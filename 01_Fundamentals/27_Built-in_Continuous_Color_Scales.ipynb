Plotly comes with a large number of\nbuilt-in continuous color scales, which can be referred to in Python code when setting the above arguments,\neither by name in a case-insensitive string e.g. `px.scatter(continuous_color_scale=\"Viridis\"`) or by reference e.g.\n`go.Scatter(marker_colorscale=plotly.colors.sequential.Viridis)`.
