As new functionality gets added to [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and to Plotly Express, certain Figure Factories become unecessary and are therefore deprecated as \"legacy\", but remain in the module for backwards-compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nThe following types of plots are still difficult to create with Graph Objects or Plotly Express and therefore the corresponding Figure Factories are _not_ deprecated:\r\n\r\n*  [Annotated Heatmaps](/python/annotated-heatmap/)\r\n*  [Dendrograms](/python/dendrogram/)\r\n*  [Hexagonal Binning Tile Map](/python/hexbin-mapbox/)\r\n*  [Quiver Plots](/python/quiver-plots/)\r\n*  [Streamline Plots](/python/streamline-plots/)\r\n*  [Tables](/python/figure-factory-table/)\r\n*  [Ternary Contour Plots](/python/ternary-contour/)\r\n*  [Triangulated Surface Plots](/python/trisurf/)\r\n\r\nDeprecated \"legacy\" Figure Factories include:\r\n\r\n*  [County Choropleth Maps](/python/county-choropleth/), deprecated by regular [Choropleth maps with GeoJSON input](/python/choropleth-maps/)\r\n*  [Distplots](/python/distplot/), mostly deprecated by [`px.histogram`](/python/histograms/) except for KDE plots, which `px.histogram` doesn't support yet\r\n*  [Gantt Charts](/python/gantt/), deprecated by [`px.timeline`](/python/gantt/)\r\n\r\n#### Reference[\u00b6](#Reference)\r\n\r\nFor more information about the contents of `plotly.figure_factory`, including deprecated methods, please refer to our [API Reference documentation](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.figure_factory.html)."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["### What About Dash?[\u00b6](#What-About-Dash?)\r\n\r\n[Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library.\r\n\r\nLearn about how to install Dash at [https://dash.plot.ly/installation](https://dash.plot.ly/installation).\r\n\r\nEverywhere in this page that you see `fig.show()`, you can display the same figure in a Dash application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dash.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dash_core_components` package like this:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go # or plotly.express as px\nfig = go.Figure() # or any Plotly Express function e.g. px.bar(...)\n# fig.add_trace( ... )\n# fig.update_layout( ... )\n\nimport dash\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\nimport dash_html_components as html\n\napp = dash.Dash()\napp.layout = html.Div([\n    dcc.Graph(figure=fig)\n])\n\napp.run_server(debug=True, use_reloader=False)  # Turn off reloader if inside Jupyter\r\n```"], "cell_type": "markdown"}], "metadata": {}}
