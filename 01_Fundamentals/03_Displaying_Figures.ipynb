Using the renderers framework in the context of a script or notebook\r\n2.  Using [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly) in a web app context\r\n3.  Using a `FigureWidget` in an `ipywidgets` context\r\n\r\nEach of these approaches is discussed below.\r\n\r\n### Displaying Figures Using The renderers Framework[\u00b6](#Displaying-Figures-Using-The-renderers-Framework)\r\n\r\nThe renderers framework is a flexible approach for displaying `plotly.py` figures in a variety of contexts.  To display a figure using the renderers framework, you call the `.show()` method on a graph object figure, or pass the figure to the `plotly.io.show` function. With either approach, `plotly.py` will display the figure using the current default renderer(s)."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfig = go.Figure(\n    data=[go.Bar(y=[2, 1, 3])],\n    layout_title_text=\"A Figure Displayed with fig.show()\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["In most situations, you can omit the call to `.show()` and allow the figure to display itself."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfig = go.Figure(\n    data=[go.Bar(y=[2, 1, 3])],\n    layout_title_text=\"A Figure Displaying Itself\"\n)\nfig\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["> To be precise, figures will display themselves using the current default renderer when the two following conditions are true. First, the last expression in a cell must evaluate to a figure. Second, `plotly.py` must be running from within an `IPython` kernel.\r\n\r\n**In many contexts, an appropriate renderer will be chosen automatically and you will not need to perform any additional configuration.** These contexts include the classic [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (provided the `jupyterlab-plotly` JupyterLab extension is installed), [Visual Studio Code notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support), [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) notebooks, [Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) notebooks, and the [Python interactive shell](https://www.python.org/shell/).\r\n\r\nAdditional contexts are supported by choosing a compatible renderer including the [IPython console](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html), [QtConsole](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and more.\r\n\r\nNext, we will show how to configure the default renderer.  After that, we will describe all of the built-in renderers and discuss why you might choose to use each one.\r\n\r\n> Note: The `renderers` framework is a generalization of the `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.offline.plot` functions that were the recommended way to display figures prior to `plotly.py` version 4.  These functions have been reimplemented using the `renderers` framework and are still supported for backward compatibility, but they will not be discussed here.\r\n\r\n#### Setting The Default Renderer[\u00b6](#Setting-The-Default-Renderer)\r\n\r\nThe current and available renderers are configured using the `plotly.io.renderers` configuration object.

This is because `plotly.py` attempts to autodetect an appropriate renderer at startup.  You can change the default renderer by assigning the name of an available renderer to the `pio.renderers.default` property.  For example, to switch to the `'browser'` renderer, which opens figures in a tab of the default web browser, you would run the following.\r\n\r\n> Note: Default renderers persist for the duration of a single session, but they do not persist across sessions.

The full plotly.js JavaScript library bundle is added to the notebook the first time a figure is rendered, so this renderer will work without an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis renderer is a good choice for notebooks that will be exported to HTML files (Either using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the \"Download as HTML\" menu action) because the exported HTML files will work without an Internet connection.\r\n\r\n> Note: Adding the plotly.js bundle to the notebook adds a few megabytes to the notebook size. If you can count on always having an Internet connection, you may want to consider using the `notebook_connected` renderer if notebook size is a constraint.\r\n\r\n###### `notebook_connected`[\u00b6](#notebook_connected)\r\n\r\nThis renderer is the same as `notebook` renderer, except the plotly.js JavaScript library bundle is loaded from an online CDN location.  This saves a few megabytes in notebook size, but an Internet connection is required in order to display figures that are rendered this way.\r\n\r\nThis renderer is a good choice for notebooks that will be shared with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) since users must have an active Internet connection to access nbviewer in the first place.\r\n\r\n###### `kaggle` and `azure`[\u00b6](#kaggle-and-azure)\r\n\r\nThese are aliases for `notebook_connected` because this renderer is a good choice for use with [Kaggle kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks) and [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/).\r\n\r\n###### `colab`[\u00b6](#colab)\r\n\r\nThis is a custom renderer for use with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\r\n\r\n###### `browser`[\u00b6](#browser)\r\n\r\nThis renderer will open a figure in a browser tab using the default web browser.  This renderer can only be used when the Python kernel is running locally on the same machine as the web browser, so it is not compatible with Jupyter Hub or online notebook services.\r\n\r\n> Implementation Note 1: In this context, the \"default browser\" is the browser that is chosen by the Python [`webbrowser`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/webbrowser.html) module.\r\n> \r\n> Implementation Note 2: The `browser` renderer works by setting up a single use local webserver on a local port. Since the webserver is shut down as soon as the figure is served to the browser, the figure will not be restored if the browser is refreshed.\r\n\r\n###### `firefox`, `chrome`, and `chromium`[\u00b6](#firefox,-chrome,-and-chromium)\r\n\r\nThese renderers are the same as the `browser` renderer, but they force the use of a particular browser.\r\n\r\n###### `iframe` and `iframe_connected`[\u00b6](#iframe-and-iframe_connected)\r\n\r\nThese renderers write figures out as standalone HTML files and then display [`iframe`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp) elements that reference these HTML files. The `iframe` renderer will include the plotly.js JavaScript bundle in each HTML file that is written, while the `iframe_connected` renderer includes only a reference to an online CDN location from which to load plotly.js.  Consequently, the `iframe_connected` renderer outputs files that are smaller than the `iframe` renderer, but it requires an Internet connection while the `iframe` renderer can operate offline.\r\n\r\nThis renderer may be useful when working with notebooks than contain lots of large figures.  When using the `notebook` or `notebook_connected` renderer, all of the data for all of the figures in a notebook are stored inline in the notebook itself. If this would result in a prohibitively large notebook size, an `iframe` or `iframe_connected` renderer could be used instead. With the `iframe` renderers, the figure data are stored in the individual HTML files rather than in the notebook itself, resulting in a smaller notebook size.\r\n\r\n> Implementation Note: The HTML files written by the `iframe` renderers are stored in a subdirectory named `iframe_figures`.  The HTML files are given names based on the execution number of the notebook cell that produced the figure. This means that each time a notebook kernel is restarted, any prior HTML files will be overwritten.  This also means that you should not store multiple notebooks using an `iframe` renderer in the same directory, because this could result in figures from one notebook overwriting figures from another notebook."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["###### `plotly_mimetype`[\u00b6](#plotly_mimetype)\r\n\r\nThe `plotly_mimetype` renderer creates a specification of the figure (called a MIME-type bundle), and requests that the current user interface displays it. User interfaces that support this renderer include [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (requires the [`jupyterlab-plotly`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyterlab-plotly) extension), [nteract](https://nteract.io/), and the Visual Studio Code [notebook interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support).\r\n\r\n###### `jupyterlab`, `nteract`, and `vscode`[\u00b6](#jupyterlab,-nteract,-and-vscode)\r\n\r\nThese are aliases for `plotly_mimetype` since this renderer is a good choice when working in JupyterLab, nteract, and the Visual Studio Code notebook interface.\r\n\r\n##### Static Image Renderers[\u00b6](#Static-Image-Renderers)\r\n\r\nA set of renderers is provided for displaying figures as static images.  These renderers all rely on the [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca) static image export utility. See the [Static Image Export](https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/) page for more information on getting set up with [orca].\r\n\r\n###### `png`, `jpeg`, and `svg`[\u00b6](#png,-jpeg,-and-svg)\r\n\r\nThese renderers display figures as static `.png`, `.jpeg`, and `.svg` files, respectively.  These renderers are useful for user interfaces that do not support inline HTML output, but do support inline static images.  Examples include the [QtConsole](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), and the PyCharm [notebook interface](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html)."], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfig = go.Figure(\n    data=[go.Bar(y=[2, 1, 3])],\n    layout_title_text=\"A Figure Displayed with the 'png' Renderer\"\n)\nfig.show(renderer=\"png\")\n\n"], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["###### PDF[\u00b6](#PDF)\r\n\r\nThis renderer displays figures as static PDF files. This is especially useful for notebooks that will be exported to PDF files using the LaTeX export capabilities of [`nbconvert`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\r\n\r\n##### Other Miscellaneous Renderers[\u00b6](#Other-Miscellaneous-Renderers)\r\n\r\n###### JSON[\u00b6](#JSON)\r\n\r\nIn editors that support it (JupyterLab, nteract, and the Visual Studio Code notebook interface), this renderer displays the JSON representation of a figure in a collapsible interactive tree structure.  This can be very useful for examining the structure of complex figures.\r\n\r\n##### Multiple Renderers[\u00b6](#Multiple-Renderers)\r\n\r\nYou can specify that multiple renderers should be used by joining their names on `\"+\"` characters.  This is useful when writing code that needs to support multiple contexts.  For example, if a notebook specifies a default renderer string of  `\"notebook+plotly_mimetype+pdf\"`then this notebook would be able to run in the classic Jupyter Notebook, in JupyterLab, and it would support being exported to PDF using `nbconvert`.\r\n\r\n#### Customizing Built-In Renderers[\u00b6](#Customizing-Built-In-Renderers)\r\n\r\nMost built-in renderers have configuration options to customize their behavior.  To view a description of a renderer, including its configuration options, access the renderer object using dictionary-style key lookup on the `plotly.io.renderers` configuration object and then display it.
